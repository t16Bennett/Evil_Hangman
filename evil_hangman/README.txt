Name: Thomas Bennett
Collaborators: Callista Coats
Challenges: The process guess function was quite challenging to figure out the logic for. I also was having some serious bugs with my dictionary map. Calli helped me debug that and other problems
as well.
Like/Dislike: I liked this because it was a challenge. I disliked the process that I used because it could be better.
Time Spent on Project: 4 hours
CPW gave me a one day extension - I didn't need it.

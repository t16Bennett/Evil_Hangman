# Evil_Hangman

This is a C++ implementation of the game "Hangman" with a twist. This version of the game tries to make the player lose by eliminating the
possible words that correspond with the letters the player has guessed. The program will continue to eliminate possibilities until it can't
anymore. In this case, the player can finally win. However, normally the player only gets a small number of tries to guess letters, so more
often than not the player will lose.
